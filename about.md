Hi! Thank you for visiting my Github.
I am Linh T. T. Tran, a PhD Candidate in Mathematics at Chungnam National University. My research concerns about Operator Theory, Dynamical Systems, Linear Dynamics, Data Analyst and Data Science.
Regards to Pure Mathematics, I focus on investigating the behaviors of operators under Aluthge transforms, generalized hyperbolic operators and their orbits.
About Data, I am interested in translating data to visual models relating to financial and social issues.


My Ph.D. is in the invariance of generalized hyperbolic operators under Aluthge transforms and solving Invariant Subspace Problem for Shadowing Operators from Chungnam National University (combined program). I earned aa bachelorâ€™s degree in Advance Mathematics at University of Science, Vietnam National University, Hanoi.

I am also a Data Analyst and Data Scientist. My recent projects are updated here.
