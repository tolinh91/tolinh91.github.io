  As a data analyst and data scientist with theorical Mathematics foundation, I visualize data into valuable, comprehensible and logical insights. My goal is to bright up results, consult customers save costs. I am experienced in Pure Mathamtics (PhD Candidate), data analysist, data scientist, supervised and unsupervised algorithms and use data visualization techniques to present the results. I use SQL, R, Python, Azure, Excel and Tableau for my data projects.
